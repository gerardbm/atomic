# Atomic
### Multiple colors for multiple applications

Atomic is a dark color scheme designed to use with terminal and several GUI applications (code editors). Color palette consists of sixteen colors for text (selected with high precision: tones easily differenciable for the human eye and luminance equilibrated, which has been calculated following the ITU-R Recommendation BT.601) and the background color.

It also includes a Zsh theme for your terminal.

Atomic has a seventeen color palette: seven dark accent colors, seven light accent colors, two extra colors for auxiliar purposes and the background color. I designed this palette for people. Each color is easily differentiable from each other. It also includes a Zsh theme for your terminal.
